								<li>Rent Fit: The guaranteed rent is just about enough cash to cover the running cost and monthly repayment. No extra cash is paid to the owner except rent earnings increase over time.</li>
								<li>Rent Insufficient: The guaranteed rent can only cover the 10% statutory letting and management fee and can cover part of the monthly repayment, the balance of the repayment is covered and paid by the owner to BuySmallSmall monthly. </li>
