	                        We have not only reduced the price barrier for anyone who has worked hard and saved up some funds to buy their first property or build their portfolio, but importantly, we’ve made it easier for young people to own real estate in Nigeria.  
	                        <p>Our platform was created to address the lack of accessibility and efficiency of a typical real estate transaction by streamlining the entire transaction process. The attractive benefits of real estate investing, including monthly cash flow and  capital/asset appreciation potential, are available to a much wider audience and that audience can invest in properties cheaper and faster than previously possible.</p>
