                <br>
                <p>The Product is designed to provide access to properties, which may be developed or undergoing construction and other BuySmallSmall Co-Ownership Properties options to the subscribers and earn the appreciation of the shares at the termination (event of shares buyback) of the subscription. this termination may be due to the effluxion of time or the shares buyback by SST. This is for the benefit of the subscribers subject to the terms and conditions and the product policies. The Product is designed to provide for all classes of people who desire to diversify portfolios or invest in the property space but cannot make such acquisition of real estate properties due to the paucity of funds. these classes of individuals or entities may now do so by purchasing unit(s) of share(s) for years and be entitled to the appreciation of the shares proportionate to the units of share held by the holder of the certificate.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Shares Accumulation & Conversion: units of shares can be accumulated, consolidated, and converted (depending on size) as a down payment or full payment to take ownership of an entire property on BuySmallSmall (T & C applies). You can do this at your own pace or you can opt for BuySmallSmall Shares Target Program(STP) where we set shares targets and challenge you to hit those targets within a set period for a chance to convert them as a down payment to own an entire property. Currently, the minimum downpayment required to access financing on BuySmallSmall is 20%, with STP, you can use your acquired shares that equal 10% value of any property of your choice as a downpayment and unlock sole ownership. BuySmallSmall Shares Target Program is powered by our Buy-Back Program. (See Shares Buy-back in the FAQ)</p>
