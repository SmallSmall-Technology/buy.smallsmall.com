                <div class="panel-body about-pockets" id="RGO">
					<div class="panel-head">GENERAL TERMS YOUR SUBSCRIPTION INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:</div>
                
                
                <p><b>Shares Allocation & Certificate:</b> When you buy one or more shares of BuySmallSmall co-ownership properties, you immediately become a co-owner and a fraction of the property shares is allotted to you based on the number of shares purchased. A shareholder certificate is also issued to you. You can buy shares of freehold properties: meaning, you can own and hold only your shares for as long as you want, you can transfer after a one year holding period, set your price and sell anytime, but the property cannot be sold as a whole except if all shareholders agreed to sell. Also, you can buy shares of fixed-hold properties: meaning, you can own and hold shares for a fixed term, you can transfer, set price and sell only your shares within the fixed term after a one year holding period and within the cap share price as stipulated by SST to reflect the market value of the property at the time of the transfer, but the property will be sold as whole at maturity of the hold period and all shareholders will enjoy the gains from the sale.</p>
                
                <p><b>Trustee Appointment:</b> For the purpose of transparency and accountability, BuySmallSmall appoints and pays a Publicly Listed Asset Management Company as Trustee(s) to hold and manage properties acquired under its co-ownership package.</p>
                
                <p><b>Property Titling:</b> All properties acquired by co-owners on BuySmallSmall are immediately registered with the State Land Registry under an SPV facilitated by the appointed independent Trustee. The original registered title documents are kept by the Trustee.</p>
                
                <p><b>Property Letting & Management:</b> All properties bought under co-ownership package are let-out and the day-to-day operation is managed by Small Small Technology. The cost is covered from our 25% Running Fund (See Running Fund below).</p>
                
                <p><b>Premium Tenants:</b> All properties acquired under our co-ownership package will be repackaged and offered as Rent2Own to premium tenants. BuySmallSmall will lock the premium tenants in a contract as a potential buyer at a pre-agreed price for a period not exceeding the property hold period. The property would be put on the platform for Premium Tenants who would pay premium rent which is a rental value higher than the market rate rental value for the purposes of facilitating the premium tenants ownership interest; fifty percent (50%) of the premium rent is used to cover the basic rent/subscription fee which is due and payable to the co-owners and will be distributed to shareholders after deducting running cost on a quarterly basis for fully developed properties. For properties undergoing development, guaranteed rent would commence upon completion and communication will effected by SST be on the start date for rent accrual; the remainder 50% of the premium rent is held as down payment towards ownership until completion of the contract, when the balance is expected to be paid by the premium tenant in order to take full possession as the new owner of the property.</p>
                
                <p><b>Guaranteed Return:</b> Co-owners with fixed-hold shares get guaranteed return upon maturity of the property hold. The guaranteed return is powered by the rent2own package with a pre-agreed price that factors in an appreciation rate, ensuring shareholders make good profit. BuySmallSmall doesn’t give guaranteed return to shareholders of freehold properties; this gives them freedom to set their own price if they want to sell at any time. However, for ease of exit, freehold shareholders can sell using BuySmallSmall secondary market, and if shares are not sold within 7 days, BuySmallSmall will offer a buy-back at an agreed rate.</p>
                
                <p><b>Guaranteed Rent:</b> All shareholders of BuySmallSmall co-ownership properties, fixed-hold or freehold, enjoy guaranteed rental income which is part of the premium rent paid by premium tenants. If a property is acquired under a fixed-hold co-ownership plan, the guaranteed rent is earned up to maturity date. If a property is acquired under a freehold co-ownership plan, the guaranteed rent is earned up to a maximum of 10 years. The guaranteed rent not only gives shareholders a passive cash flow, but it ensures the property has enough cash-flow to cover running costs which include property insurance, property maintenance, property management, and land-use-charge. Net Rent (gross rent minus all expenses) is distributed quarterly to shareholders in the portion of shares owned.</p>
                
                <p><b>Running Fund:</b> Shareholders of BuySmallSmall Co-ownership properties enjoy zero out-of-pocket cost on any property they co-own. This is made possible through a 25% deductible (Cap) from the Guaranteed rent and set aside as Running Fund from the rent revenue before the 75% is distributed to shareholders quarterly. For fixed-hold properties, all expenses of the property are covered till the maturity of the hold. For freehold properties, all expenses are covered throughout the 10 years guaranteed rent period.</p>
                
                <p><b>Property Insurance:</b> Every BuySmallSmall co-owned property is insured year on year under a premium plan that covers damages arising from fire and other disasters. The cost is covered from our 25% Running Fund.</p>
                
                <p><b>Property maintenance:</b> For a co-owned property to increase in value, proper maintenance structure must be in place. BuySmallSmall is positioned to prevent maintenance issues before they happen, and/or attend to issues swiftly when they happen, and the cost is covered from the 25% Running Fund.</p>
                
                <p><b>Land Use Charge (LUC):</b> Every property is billed by the state government annually for Land Use Charge. The cost is covered from our 25% Running Fund.</p>
