						They both have their unique advantages. The price of uncompleted property is cheaper, therefore your shares give you better appreciation on your capital, although you won’t start earning rent return until the property is completed. For completed property, the property is priced higher, therefore your shares will command slightly lower capital appreciation return compared to uncompleted property, however, you won’t wait to start earning rent return.

BuySmallSmall doesn’t give guaranteed appreciation return to co-owners of freehold properties; this gives them freedom to set their own price if they want to sell at any time.

						To subscribe to Rent2Own package, Premium Tenants are vetted and selected and they are required to pay a premium rent which is a rental value higher than the market rate for the purposes of facilitating their ownership interest. The premium rent is 100% markup of the guaranteed rent. The guaranteed rent covers the basic rent/subscription fee which is due and payable to the co-owners quarterly after deducting the property running cost. The mark-up is kept as downpayment towards ownership till completion of the contract, when the premium tenant is expected to pay the balance in order to take full possession as the new owner of the property.

						If outstanding debt is not cleared within the 2 days grace, we will issue a notice of termination on the third day via email with intent to repossess property if all outstanding debt is not cleared on or before the next payback due date. Each day carries a late payment penalty. If the outstanding debt plus lateness fee is carried into a second month up to the due date of the second month, this translates to 2 months consecutive default which automatically leads to termination of contract.

	                        <b>Gross yield:</b> A yield on investment property before any expenses. This is calculated as gross annual rent divided by purchase price.
                            <b>Cap rate:</b> Similar to gross yield but includes all of your expenses (except loan costs). This is calculated as net annual rent income in Year 1 divided by purchase price.
                            <b>Cash yield:</b> This is a measure of return on your initial investment after your first full year of ownership. This is calculated as net cash flow, after all expenses and loan payments, divided by initial investment amount.
                            <b>Annualized return:</b> Estimate of the value the investment generates over the time period for which you own it (including cash flow and appreciation).
